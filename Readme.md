# Welcome to the Script# Project #

Script# is a development tool that generates JavaScript by compiling C# source code. It is especially interesting for scripting-in-the-large scenarios that is commonplace in the current generation of HTML5 and script-based Web applications.

Script# lets you leverage the productivity of C# (intellisense, build-time error checking, natural language syntax), and the power Visual Studio IDE and standard .NET tools (such as msbuild, refactoring, unit testing, static analysis, code visualization, fxcop). Script# brings all this to you without abstracting the runtime environment - you're still authoring script, just with a different set of tools.

You can even use Script# to work against other existing frameworks and APIs such as jQuery, jQuery plugins and Knockout, and can be extended to work against other existing script.

Script# requires .NET 4.0 and Visual Studio 2010 or (the free) Visual Web Developer Express 2010.

## Current Status ##

Script# has been an ongoing project for many years, and as such is quite usable. It is in fact used across a number of large (and some *very* large) and successful deployed projects, both within Microsoft and amongst other developers.

One area where Script# lacks is good and current documentation. While this is addressed (please stay tuned), be sure to check out the [sample apps](https://github.com/nikhilk/scriptsharp/tree/master/samples) in the repository.

There is always room for further improvement that range from bug fixes to full-blown features. If you have feedback or suggestions, be sure to [file an issue](https://github.com/nikhilk/scriptsharp/issues).

The current release is v0.7.4. The next release, v0.7.5 is slated to be a bug fix release. Thereafter work will begin on a major update that brings about a much improved script generation model that incorporates a number of learnings over the years.
